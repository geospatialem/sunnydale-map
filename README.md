# Buffy's Sunnydale Map

## Background
A 'static' cartographic map of the city of Sunnydale, California based on the Buffy the Vampire Slayer television series.

## Project Efforts
This project "officially" started on Sunday, January 3rd, 2016. The first initial deadline is mid-October 2017 for the Minnesota GIS/LIS Conference.

Because I am curious how long this project will take I will be updating a rough time log, with some general activities and hours. I am hopeful that the effort will help non-cartographers understand the overall level of effort to make a poster for a conference, and will help justify conference discounts in the future.
